Amazon ElastiCache now supports AWS Graviton2-based T4g, M6g, R6g instances in the Europe (Paris, Milan) regions and R6gd instances in the Europe (Paris) region
Posted On: Aug 4, 2022

Amazon ElastiCache now supports AWS Graviton2-based T4g, M6g and R6g node types in the Europe (Paris) and Europe (Milan) regions. Customers choose Amazon ElastiCache for workloads that require blazing-fast performance with sub-millisecond latency and high throughput. Now, with Graviton2 T4g, M6g and R6g instances, customers can enjoy up to a 45% price/performance improvement over previous generation instances.

Additionally, you can now use data tiering for Amazon ElastiCache for Redis as a lower cost way to scale your clusters to up to hundreds of terabytes of capacity in the Europe (Paris) region. Data tiering provides a new price-performance option for Redis workloads by utilizing lower-cost solid state drives (SSDs) in each cluster node in addition to storing data in memory. It is ideal for workloads that access up to 20% of their overall dataset regularly, and for applications that can tolerate additional latency when accessing data on SSD. ElastiCache data tiering is available when using Redis version 6.2 and above on Graviton2-based R6gd nodes. R6gd nodes have nearly 5x more total capacity (memory + SSD) and can help you achieve over 60% savings when running at maximum utilization compared to R6g nodes (memory only).

AWS Graviton2 processors are custom built by AWS using 64-bit Arm Neoverse cores to deliver top-tier price performance for your cloud workloads. The Amazon ElastiCache memory optimized R6g offers memory from 13.07 GiB to 419.10 GiB, the memory optimized R6gd offers memory from 26.32 GiB to 419.09 GiB in addition to NVMe-based SSD storage from 99.33 GiB to 1592.56 GiB, the general purpose M6g offers memory from 6.38 GiB to 209.55 GiB, and the general purpose T4g offers memory from 0.5 GiB to 3.09 GiB. The Graviton2-based T4g, M6g, R6g and R6gd instances leverage the AWS Nitro System and ENA (Elastic Network Adapter). You can purchase these instances as On-Demand or as Reserved Nodes with 1 or 3 year commitment periods.
